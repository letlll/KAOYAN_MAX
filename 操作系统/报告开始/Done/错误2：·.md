Thank you for providing the `run.txt` content and further context. Based on the debug output from your program and the provided `run.txt`, the issue seems to be related to how the **program names** are being extracted in the `loadRunSteps` function. Let‚Äôs analyze and fix the problem systematically.

---

### **Error Analysis**

From the output in the image:

1. `Updated runtime for :` indicates that the `currentProgram` variable is empty.
2. `Program: , Time: 100` shows that the `currentProgram` key in `runTimes` is also empty.
3. As a result, `loadProcesses` cannot find `ProgramA`, `ProgramB`, etc., in the `runTimes` map, leading to warnings like:
    
    ```
    Warning: Program ProgramA not found in runTimes. Skipping process AProgram.
    ```
    

The issue lies in **`line.substr(4)`** inside `loadRunSteps`:

- The `substr(4)` assumes a fixed character offset after `"Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç "`. However, `run.txt` contains a **tab character** (`\t`) between `"Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç"` and the actual program name, causing the extraction to fail.

---

### **Fix for `loadRunSteps`**

We need to handle **variable whitespace or tab spacing** after `"Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç"` to correctly extract the program name.

#### Updated `loadRunSteps` Function

Here‚Äôs the fixed implementation:

```cpp
map<string, int> loadRunSteps() {
    ifstream file("run.txt");
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        cerr << "Error: Could not open run.txt" << endl;
        return {};
    }

    map<string, int> runTimes;
    string line, currentProgram;

    while (getline(file, line)) {
        // Check if the line starts with "Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç"
        if (line.find("Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç") == 0) {
            // Extract the program name by skipping "Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç" and any whitespace/tab
            size_t pos = line.find_first_not_of(" \t", 4); // Skip "Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç " (4 characters)
            if (pos != string::npos) {
                currentProgram = line.substr(pos); // Extract the program name
                cout << "Found program: " << currentProgram << endl; // Debug output
            } else {
                cerr << "Error: Program name missing after 'Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç'." << endl;
            }
        } else if (!line.empty()) {
            // Extract the time for this program
            int time;
            stringstream ss(line);
            ss >> time;
            if (runTimes.find(currentProgram) == runTimes.end() || runTimes[currentProgram] < time) {
                runTimes[currentProgram] = time;
                cout << "Updated runtime for " << currentProgram << ": " << time << endl; // Debug message
            }
        }
    }

    file.close();
    return runTimes;
}
```

### **Explanation of Fix**

1. **`find_first_not_of(" \t", 4)`**:
    
    - Skips any spaces or tabs after the `"Á®ãÂ∫èÂêç "` prefix (4 characters).
    - Ensures the program name is extracted even if there are mixed spaces and tabs.
2. **Debug Logging**:
    
    - `cout` statements log every detected program and its runtime for verification.
3. **Error Handling**:
    
    - If `currentProgram` is missing or empty, an error is logged.

---

### **Expected Output after Fix**

When running the updated code with your provided `run.txt`, the debug output should now include:

```
Found program: ProgramA
Updated runtime for ProgramA: 5
Updated runtime for ProgramA: 10
Updated runtime for ProgramA: 20
Updated runtime for ProgramA: 30
Updated runtime for ProgramA: 70
Updated runtime for ProgramA: 100
Found program: ProgramB
Updated runtime for ProgramB: 3
Updated runtime for ProgramB: 10
...
```

---

### **Verification**

1. Check that `runTimes` now contains all programs (`ProgramA`, `ProgramB`, etc.) with their correct maximum times.
    
    - Add debug output in `loadProcesses` to display the contents of `runTimes`.
2. Check that `loadProcesses` no longer skips any processes.

### **Full Updated `loadProcesses` with Debugging**

To ensure the `runTimes` map is correctly passed to `loadProcesses`, include debug output in `loadProcesses` as well:

```cpp
void loadProcesses(map<string, int>& runTimes) {
    cout << "Loaded runTimes:" << endl;
    for (const auto& [program, time] : runTimes) {
        cout << "Program: " << program << ", Time: " << time << endl; // Debug output
    }

    ifstream file("process.txt");
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        cerr << "Error: Could not open process.txt" << endl;
        return;
    }

    string line;
    while (getline(file, line)) {
        stringstream ss(line);
        string pName, pRemark;
        int createTime, grade;
        ss >> pName >> createTime >> grade >> pRemark; // Parse process info
        if (runTimes.find(pRemark) != runTimes.end()) {
            processList.emplace_back(pName, createTime, runTimes[pRemark], grade, pRemark);
        } else {
            cerr << "Warning: Program " << pRemark << " not found in runTimes. Skipping process " << pName << "." << endl;
        }
    }
    file.close();
}
```

### **Next Steps**

1. Replace the `loadRunSteps` and `loadProcesses` functions with the updated versions.
2. Run the program and verify:
    - Debug output shows all programs (`ProgramA`, `ProgramB`, etc.) detected with their correct maximum times.
    - No warnings for missing programs.
3. Share the updated debug output if the issue persists.
