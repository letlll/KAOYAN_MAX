Language: en
Label: 英语 (自动生成)

0
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
the problem is somatic chain

1
00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.210
multiplication in this video I'll

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.790
explain you what is matrix

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.410
multiplication problem then what does it

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410
mean by Mattox much change

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.210
multiplication then I will show how to

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
solve this by applying dynamic

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.470
programming then we will come up with

8
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.409
the formula that is used for solving

9
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.900
this problem and also I will discuss the

10
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.810
time complexity so let us start with

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.890
matrix multiplication first of all if

12
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.040
you have matrix 2 matrices and you want

13
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.860
to multiply them and their dimensions

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.239
are suppose Phi cross 4 and 4 cross 3

15
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.550
the condition for multiplying two

16
00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.140
matrices the number of columns of the

17
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.760
first matrix should be equal to number

18
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.789
of rows of second Matrix then only

19
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.250
multiplication can be done if I write

20
00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.129
other way B cross a then their

21
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.170
dimensions 4 cross 3 and Phi cross 4

22
00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.899
will be there they cannot be multiplied

23
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
because these are not same so a cross B

24
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.900
is fit is possible then B cross a is

25
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.600
also possible it's not necessary when

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.700
you multiply the resultant matrix will

27
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.399
be C and the dimension of that resultant

28
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.990
matrix will be Phi cross 3 number of

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.340
rows of first one and number of columns

30
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.560
of last one by cross 3 so it means how

31
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.460
many elements will be there so 15

32
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.560
elements will be there then for getting

33
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.460
each element what we are supposed to do

34
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.310
multiply first row with first column so

35
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.189
how many elements first row will have

36
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.680
four elements and this will also have

37
00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.689
four elements that is 4 you can see so

38
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.030
total four multiplications I have to do

39
00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.158
for getting this one single element then

40
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.710
again first row with second column I get

41
00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.170
this element so it means for getting

42
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.360
each element of the same matrix I have

43
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.149
to make four multiplications so this is

44
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.350
into four so finally it is like this 5

45
00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.110
into 3 into 4 this is 16 so it means for

46
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.798
generating the C matrix I have to make

47
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.800
60 multiplications 5 4 3 60

48
00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.420
multiplications

49
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.270
quite right so this about the cost of

50
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.040
multiplying two matrices depends on the

51
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.320
number of multiplications that you are

52
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
performing so how to obtain the number

53
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.570
of multiplication this or we can find

54
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.850
out the number of multiplications now

55
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.280
coming to the problem here for medicines

56
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.140
are given and the dimensions are given

57
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.760
they are arranged such that they can be

58
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.820
multiplied because these are same you

59
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.370
see and the 6x is same 2 2 is same so

60
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.040
they can be multiplied but the question

61
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.260
is not to multiply and get the answer no

62
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.329
we don't want the answer for multiplying

63
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.130
I cannot multiply all of them together I

64
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.740
have to take a pair at a time and

65
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.320
multiply so the question is which

66
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.650
parachutes select such that the total

67
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.600
cost of multiplying all of them is

68
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.820
minimum so the problem is not to

69
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.100
multiply them the problem is to know how

70
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.310
to multiply them this is matrix

71
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.769
multiplication problem it means how I

72
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.710
should parenthesize them shall I do it

73
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.590
like this a 1 is multiplied with a 2 and

74
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.770
that result is multiplied with a 3 and

75
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.260
that result is multiplied with a 4 shall

76
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.160
we do it like this or a 1 and a 2 are

77
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.620
multiplied and separately a 3 and a 4

78
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.329
are multiplied then their results are

79
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.270
multiplied together which method I

80
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.950
should follow see like this how many

81
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.620
possibilities are there there are many

82
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.780
ways I can parenthesize them so let me

83
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.020
know total how many ways are there so if

84
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.739
I show this in the form of a tree a 1 is

85
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.910
multiplied with a 2 then a 3 is

86
00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.500
multiplied with a 4 then their results

87
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.400
are multiplied so it is forming like a

88
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.810
tree right if you see this is forming

89
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.040
like tree with how many nodes three

90
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.600
nodes because there are three

91
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.230
multiplications out of four mattresses

92
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.350
so three knows we are getting so for

93
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.200
this one if I represent then this is a 1

94
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.709
is multiplied with a 2 and that result

95
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.339
is multiplied with a 3 and that result

96
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.250
is multiplied with a 4 see this is

97
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.709
representing that pattern that tree is

98
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.639
representing this parenthesis ation so

99
00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.469
like this

100
00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.870
three nodes how many different trees are

101
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:28.120
possible so it means how many different

102
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.419
parenthesize Asians are possible see

103
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.430
four unknowns - n c n by n plus one

104
00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.469
binary trees are possible now for three

105
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.479
nodes how many it will be if I

106
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:44.439
substitute three here then I get answer

107
00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.349
five so it means these matrices can be

108
00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.999
multiplied in five different ways five

109
00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.599
different ways they can be parenthesized

110
00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:55.509
which one I want I want minimum so shall

111
00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:59.080
I try all five and calculate their total

112
00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:02.229
cost and pick up the best one no I don't

113
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.529
have to do it like this no doubt I have

114
00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.199
to try all possible five but I will

115
00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.779
follow easy method that is given by

116
00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.849
dynamic programming so dynamic

117
00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.009
programming says that you try out all

118
00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.500
possibilities and pick up the best one

119
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.900
so how to try all possibilities it is

120
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.210
difficult for every problem even they

121
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.489
may be missing some possibility also so

122
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.109
without missing anything how to get the

123
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.270
perfect answer by trying all

124
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.120
possibilities now we will see how to

125
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.330
solve this problem let us solve this

126
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.669
problem using dynamic programming as a

127
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.770
dynamic programming uses tabulation

128
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.549
method so these are the tables I have I

129
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:46.060
will call this with named M and this

130
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.599
with named s any name you can give M as

131
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.689
the name I have taken now we will fill

132
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:56.800
up this table and in tabulation method

133
00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:58.599
will follow bottom of approach we should

134
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.219
take the smaller values and fill the

135
00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.620
table first so actually we are talking

136
00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:07.509
about multiplication so let us take just

137
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.879
a 1 not multiplied with anything just a

138
00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.620
1 so what is the cost of multiplication

139
00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:15.399
it's not multiplied with anything so the

140
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.430
cost of zero so when I say a 1 so let me

141
00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:24.159
call it as M of 1 comma 1 so M of 1

142
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:26.819
comma 1 is 0 then if I take a 2 just a 2

143
00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.438
then this will be M of 2 comma 2 and

144
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:33.060
there is nothing multiplied so this is

145
00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:37.110
also 0 same way M of 3 comma 3 0 4 comma

146
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:41.310
for you see so this is small problem let

147
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.680
us find out M of 1 comma 2 M of 1 comma

148
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:50.370
2 means I am multiplying two matrices

149
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:52.730
that is 1 2 2 so a 1 with a 2 then what

150
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:59.250
are the dimensions of a 1 5 4 and

151
00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:02.040
dimensions of a 2 4 6 so what will the

152
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:08.940
total cost of multiplication 5 into 4

153
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:10.530
into 6 this is 120 so I am off 1 comma 2

154
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.490
that is multiplying this pair of

155
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:17.789
matrixes 120 so here I write 1 2 in the

156
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.800
first value and for this one with the

157
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.380
two I multiplied so I will take it as 1

158
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.530
so at same 1 comma 2 I will write it as

159
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:31.500
1 why I am writing that I will explain

160
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:33.690
after some time now next I will try a 1

161
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.550
2 2 is over now 2 2 3

162
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.740
I will select this page first I selected

163
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.990
this mix am selecting this after that

164
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:46.169
I'll be selecting this so 2 2 3 I will

165
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:50.430
select so M of 2 to 3 that is a 2 with a

166
00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:57.419
3 what are the dimensions 4 comma 6 and

167
00:07:50.430 --> 00:08:03.780
6 comma 2 4 into 6 and 6 into 2 so this

168
00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:07.049
will be 48 right so 2 comma 3 M of 2

169
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:11.580
comma 3 is 48 so I am filling this

170
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:16.350
diagonally next I will be selecting a 3

171
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:19.039
4 so here I will write on M of 3 comma 4

172
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:26.250
will be multiplying these two matrices

173
00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:35.458
so their dimensions are 6 2 + 2 7 right

174
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:40.020
so 6 into 2 into 7 is 84 so 3 comma 4 3

175
00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:42.989
comma 4 is filled with 84 so now I have

176
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.210
the cost of multiplying pair of Madison

177
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:48.990
and there are different way possible I

178
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.520
have taken all possible pairs now to two

179
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.100
medicines were selected now we will

180
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.220
select three matrix so that is I will

181
00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:02.610
find out a of 1 comma 3 and 1 comma 3

182
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:05.490
means a 1 a 2 and a 3 so when we

183
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:08.520
consider all three then there are two

184
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:12.390
possibilities one s this is multiplied

185
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.910
the result of this or first a1 and a2

186
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.310
are multiplied and their result is

187
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.610
multiplied by a 3 there are two

188
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.589
possibilities now what is the cost of

189
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.140
what are the name what are the

190
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:33.630
dimensions of this phi cross 4 and this

191
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:37.020
is for draw 6 6 2 & 5 4 4 6 6 2 now what

192
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:41.070
is the cost of a of one this is nothing

193
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:45.780
but m 1 comma 1 plus what is the cost of

194
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:47.550
this M 2 2 3 2 2 3 then what is the cost

195
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.589
of this multiplication see this is

196
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.569
already done we know the cost right 2

197
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.220
comma 3 I have written I want to know

198
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.620
only this multiplication just 1

199
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.460
multiplication so this depends on the

200
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:04.620
dimension so what are the dimensions 5 &

201
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:08.130
4 2 so 5 4 2 so the result of this will

202
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:12.210
be 4 cross 2 so 5 into 4 into 2 so this

203
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:18.030
will be 5 into 4 into 2 then what about

204
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:21.060
the site this is M of 1 comma 2 plus M

205
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:24.329
off this is just 3 so write the 3 comma

206
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.760
3 then plus what are the dimension see

207
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:32.400
the final dimensions of this one will be

208
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:38.670
these 2 so 5 into 6 into 2 5 into 6 into

209
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:46.579
2 now M of 1 comma 1 is how much 0 plus

210
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:52.560
M of 2 3 2 3 is 48 plus how much this is

211
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:54.840
40 then M of 1 comma 2 1 comma 2 is 120

212
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.219
Plus

213
00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:04.800
mm of 3 3 3 comma 3 is 0 plus how much

214
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:08.790
this is 60 right

215
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:14.339
which one is minimum this is 88 and this

216
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:19.740
is 180 this is meaning so M of 1 comma 3

217
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:21.900
is 88 M of 1 comma 3 is 88 now here

218
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:25.680
there were two possibilities we have

219
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:28.439
tried this one versus this one and took

220
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.839
meaning amount of these two right we

221
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.510
have taken minimum of these two so who

222
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:37.290
has given minimum this one was this side

223
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:40.020
and 2 3 4 2 3 was that side so one has

224
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:44.819
given us the result so for this value I

225
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:47.670
should write 1 here as I find out M of 2

226
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:52.350
comma 4 means I should select these

227
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:55.920
three so M of 2 comma 4 in this there

228
00:11:52.350 --> 00:12:01.200
are 2 possibilities a 2 multiplied with

229
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:05.880
the result of this 1 or a 2 multiplied

230
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.350
with a 3 and the result of it a for C in

231
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.410
this way I am trying all possibilities

232
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:12.420
but an easy method because the result I

233
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.829
can get it from the table from the table

234
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:18.240
I am getting the values and I am filling

235
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:22.880
the table let us take this four six six

236
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:29.130
two two seven four six six two two seven

237
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:33.390
four six six two two seven now what is

238
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:38.910
this one this is M of 2 2 plus this side

239
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:42.000
is M of three four plus what will be the

240
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:44.430
product of this one see we will get this

241
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.650
as a dimension right and these two are

242
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:51.180
same so they are multiplied 4 into 6

243
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:55.829
into 7 4 into 6 into 7 then what about

244
00:12:51.180 --> 00:13:02.010
this side this is M of 2 to 3 plus M off

245
00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:04.020
4 to 4 plus the result of this one will

246
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.499
be this one and as these two are same

247
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:11.569
then final will be 4a 2

248
00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:14.869
to Windows 7 so 4 into 2 into 7 let us

249
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:21.199
see how much mrs. M of 2 comma 2 2 comma

250
00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:30.289
2 is 0 plus M of 3 for M of 3 comma 4 is

251
00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:39.608
84 then this is 168 then M of 2 3 2 3 is

252
00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:41.718
how much 48 48 plus M 4 4 is 0 plus 56

253
00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:47.379
so which one is smaller

254
00:13:41.719 --> 00:13:50.419
this is 252 and this is one not four

255
00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:52.939
so which one is minimum one not for is

256
00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:56.059
minimum so the answer for this one is 1

257
00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:59.929
not 4 that is 2 comma 4 2 comma 4 is

258
00:13:56.059 --> 00:14:03.228
over not for and who give this value see

259
00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:06.889
this side is 2 3 and that side is 4 so

260
00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:09.019
answer is 3 so 3 has given us minimum

261
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:13.009
resinate how to find out this final

262
00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:17.749
value that is all 4 so we tried to then

263
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:22.869
3 at a time no 400 now M of 1 comma 4 so

264
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:30.849
now I will use the formula and show you

265
00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:39.769
write use the formula M of 1 comma 4 is

266
00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:43.609
minimum of M of 1 comma 1 plus M of 2

267
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:44.509
comma 4 C 1 comma 1 this side then 2 to

268
00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:46.999
4 remaining

269
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:49.039
Plus what will be the cost of

270
00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:52.309
multiplying them from here I will see

271
00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:58.129
this is 1 and these are together 2 to 4

272
00:14:52.309 --> 00:15:02.389
so this is 5 into 4 into 7 so 5 into 4

273
00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:04.219
into 7 comma I have to take the minimum

274
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:06.949
this is one possibility

275
00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:12.049
1 a 1 is this side and all 3 that side

276
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:15.169
so I wrote here 1 then again M off 1

277
00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:18.199
comma C that time I wrote one here now I

278
00:15:15.169 --> 00:15:18.810
will write 2 here so then plus M off

279
00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:21.810
this will

280
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:24.420
three four so this means one two to the

281
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:27.239
side and three to four that side so two

282
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:30.779
separate plus what will be the cost of

283
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:34.430
this one five four and seven sorry five

284
00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:37.350
or six and seven so 5 into 6 into

285
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:43.560
seventh then there are two more

286
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:47.220
possibilities here write em off 1c first

287
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:52.939
time 1 so decide to then next is to know

288
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:57.180
it is a 3 1 comma 3 plus M of 4 comma 4

289
00:15:52.940 --> 00:16:02.010
so 1 2 3 this side and 4 that side so

290
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:05.400
this is 5 into 2 into 7 so 5 into 2 into

291
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:08.220
7 that's it so what are the

292
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.439
possibilities I have only 1 decide 3

293
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.650
that side or to this side to that side

294
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:16.110
or 3 this side and one that side so all

295
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.540
possibilities I have taken here I have

296
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:21.900
to find out what is the cost of this one

297
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:25.530
see this is 0 and 2 comma 4 is how much

298
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:29.069
1 not for one not for under this is 40

299
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:42.720
and this is M of 1 comma 2 is how much

300
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:45.420
120 plus 3 comma 4 is 84 plus 2 10 and 1

301
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:50.790
comma 3 is how much fun comma 3 is 88

302
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:54.569
this is 88 plus 4 comma 4 is 0 and this

303
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:59.160
one is 7 and D naught of this which

304
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:05.339
seems to be smaller this is 200 and this

305
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:08.550
is a 3 400 above and this is 158 yes

306
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:14.280
this has given us a smaller result so

307
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:20.280
the result is 158 then on what value I

308
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:25.139
got the sons are 3 so this is 3 that's

309
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:27.990
it I have filled the table right so

310
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:32.160
finally I have used the formula slowly I

311
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.750
have build a formula right so finally I

312
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.600
have

313
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.429
build a table not two tables already now

314
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.320
we need to know the answer before

315
00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:43.820
knowing the answer I will write down the

316
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:53.539
formula say here if I say em off I comma

317
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:56.090
J minimum of what is this I'm off I to

318
00:17:53.539 --> 00:18:00.559
some K so you can see that this was 1 so

319
00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:05.689
2 then 2 then 3 then 3 and 4 so I'm off

320
00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:09.080
I comma k plus M off k plus 1 comma J

321
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:14.929
this is the form - this is 1 comma 1 so

322
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:18.530
2 2 4 1 2 2 3 2 4 so 1 2 3 4 - 4 i2 k k

323
00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:21.080
plus 1 to j then plus this was getting

324
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:24.740
multiplied these are getting multiplied

325
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.830
so how I should represent them now from

326
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:30.860
the example I will show you so if I say

327
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:34.399
this is a tension 1 then this is a

328
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:38.120
dimension 2 then this is a dimension 3

329
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.030
then this is a dimension 4 then this I

330
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.039
have to call it as a dimension 0 like

331
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.080
there are four mattresses for total 5

332
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:47.510
dimensions so I should start from zero

333
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.809
so see otherwise if I start from 1 I

334
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:53.629
will end up at 5 but the last matrix is

335
00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:57.020
4 so let us start from zero dimension 0

336
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.940
1 2 3 4 so when I am multiplying any

337
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.960
matrix see when I am multiplying the

338
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:06.049
matters that is I t 2k + 1 2 change so I

339
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.690
should take I so if I is this matrix

340
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:14.950
then I should take this 1 I minus 1 so

341
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:23.299
this is d of I minus 1 into D of K into

342
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:25.669
D of J this is the formula now let me

343
00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:27.799
follow this table the one which was

344
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:31.850
giving minimum I was writing them here

345
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:36.559
so the first topmost one what it says 3

346
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:39.350
so it means this side then this is

347
00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:42.799
separate so this is one parenthesis at

348
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:45.370
the 3 this is splitted K is a 3 so 1 2 3

349
00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:48.820
is this side and for that side

350
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:53.260
right no what about one two three so if

351
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:57.460
I check 1 2 3 it is 1 1 2 3 is giving 1

352
00:19:53.260 --> 00:20:01.980
so 1 this side so a 1 this side then

353
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:04.660
what that side is remaining a 2 and a 3

354
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:11.440
then all the way this outer bracket was

355
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:14.380
there then a 4 that's it 2 2 3 so 2 2 3

356
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.840
gives us 4 2 only so there are only 2 so

357
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:21.610
let them be as it is so how it looks

358
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.169
like C a2 and a3 are multiplied first

359
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:27.159
and we get this result

360
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:30.880
then a1 is multiplied with a result all

361
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:34.450
right then a4 s multiplied with their

362
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.150
result that's how the multiplication

363
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:41.560
will be done this is a train we got of

364
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:44.290
this shape we got right so this is a

365
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.120
solution now let us check what is the

366
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.920
time complexity so actually we are

367
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.780
preparing a table but we are not

368
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.690
preparing entire table we are preparing

369
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:55.660
half of the table so also you can say n

370
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:59.470
into n plus 1 by 2 number of elements we

371
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:03.640
are generating right see this is 1 then

372
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:05.470
2 then 3 so on so n in n plus 1 or n

373
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.840
minus 1 also you can say because this

374
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.880
diagonal is all 0 so really you want to

375
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.840
consider or not so anyway this is going

376
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:16.390
to be N squared approximately n square

377
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.510
right if you want to write notation it's

378
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.880
n square but each element how we are

379
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.670
getting we are calculating all and

380
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:29.770
finding the minimum so how much time it

381
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:33.190
takes at most n so this is into n so the

382
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:36.730
time complexity of this one is n cube so

383
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:39.340
this is Theta of n cube so the time

384
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.190
complexity for Mattox chain

385
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.639
multiplication is n cube multiplying the

386
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.860
mattis's also in queue and solving the

387
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:52.210
parent isolation problem of mitosis is

388
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:55.750
also n cube then lastly I will show one

389
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.780
more thing the stable I draw it like

390
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.780
this

391
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.889
right because we are not using this

392
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.039
portion so first row I will write like

393
00:22:02.889 --> 00:22:09.610
this this is first row right then this

394
00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:11.549
is second row then this is third row and

395
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:15.969
this is fourth row

396
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:19.480
so these are rows 1 2 3 so this is 1 2 3

397
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:22.419
4 so if I say I is for row and J is for

398
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.509
column so these are I so I'll write I

399
00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:28.509
hear right that side from that satisfy C

400
00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:32.580
then these are columns so these are

401
00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:35.980
columns so this is 1 2 3 4 so this are J

402
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:43.869
then what is the value here 158 and this

403
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:47.830
is 88 and 1 not 4 and 1 2048 and 84 0 0

404
00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:49.779
0 0 this is how a table is prepared

405
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:54.158
instead of drawing it like this and half

406
00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:54.610
unfilled or empty we can also draw it

407
00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:57.429
like this

408
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.850
so just done is that site you get this

409
00:22:57.429 --> 00:22:59.850
table
