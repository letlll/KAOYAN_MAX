0
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.879
the problem is 01 Absa

1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.559
problem in this video I will explain

2
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.399
what is 01 napsack problem and how it

3
00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.320
can be solved using dynamic programming

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.480
we will understand its approach next I

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.279
will show you a tabular method for

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.519
solving this one then also I will show

7
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.119
you a sets method for solving this one

8
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.919
so there are two methods we will see

9
00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.439
both the methods first of all let us

10
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.879
understand what the problem is

11
00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.559
here I have some four objects for each

12
00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.440
object there is some profit and there is

13
00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.879
some

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.920
weight and there is a bag of capacity M

15
00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.919
that is 8 is

16
00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.280
given the objective is to fill this back

17
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.199
with these objects so can I put them all

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.160
see the capacity a is eight but the

19
00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.079
total weights of all these object is 14

20
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.640
so all objects cannot be filled in the

21
00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.519
bag so I have to carry few of those some

22
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.760
of those objects that is subset of those

23
00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.479
objects and I have to carry them and

24
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.920
sell them at other place so once I sell

25
00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.799
I get this

26
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.040
profit so I have to fill the object such

27
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.040
that the total profit is

28
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.759
maximized and I have to give the

29
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.320
solution in the form of a set for each

30
00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.000
object like for example this is included

31
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.960
and this is not included or not included

32
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.360
like this I have to write down which one

33
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.158
is included and not included so it means

34
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.159
I can write down each XI either 0 or 1

35
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.680
means the values can be 0 or 1 but not

36
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.640
fraction so it means that the object

37
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.240
that I'm going to carry are not

38
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.000
divisible breakable so I cannot take the

39
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.798
fraction of that object so this means

40
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.719
these are some solid objects maybe a

41
00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.119
mixer or microwave1 or a router it can

42
00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.479
be something like this so which I cannot

43
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.640
take a half of mixer in the bag so these

44
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.280
are indivisible objects so either I

45
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.840
should carry the whole object or don't

46
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.160
carry it at all so I have to carry the

47
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.800
object such that the sum of their

48
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.920
profits should be

49
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.640
maximized and some of

50
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.679
their weights should be less than or

51
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.000
equal to the capacity of the

52
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.920
back now let us know the approach of

53
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.480
dynamic programming for solving this one

54
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.920
now few important things about dynamic

55
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.560
programming dynamic programming is

56
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.958
useful for solving optimization problem

57
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.000
yes this demands maximum results so it's

58
00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.159
optimization problem second thing

59
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.400
dynamic programming says that a problem

60
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.440
should be solved in sequence of

61
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.200
decisions so yes we can take the

62
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.920
sequence of decisions for every object

63
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.480
we can take shall I include or not

64
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.559
include or not include or not so I can

65
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.440
take decisions I can even start taking

66
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.879
the decision from the last object also

67
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.680
include or not include or so usually in

68
00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.319
this one we take the decision from last

69
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.560
object towards first object so we can

70
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.518
take sequence of decision next thing one

71
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.920
more point that dynamic programming says

72
00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.040
that you should try all possible

73
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.040
solutions and pick up the best one now

74
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.120
how many possible solutions are there

75
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.440
see when I'm writing the solution in the

76
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.760
form of zeros and ones then it can be 0

77
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.159
0 0 means no object is included or 1 one

78
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.079
one one means all objects are included

79
00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.480
or 0 0 0 1 means only fourth object is

80
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.879
included or first object is

81
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.280
included or first two objects are

82
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.760
included like this there are many

83
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.879
possible solutions and some of them may

84
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.959
be feasible some may not be feasible

85
00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.720
like all objects I cannot include so

86
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.920
anyway I should try all of them and pick

87
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.480
up the best one so total how many

88
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.720
solutions will be there so like four

89
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.319
zeros and ones form if I continue so

90
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.599
I'll be getting 2^ 4

91
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.798
Solutions so I should try 2 power 4

92
00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.359
solution for n objects it will be 2

93
00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.480
power n solution

94
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.480
so if I try out all then the time

95
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.000
complexity will be 2^

96
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.159
n this is too much time consuming so

97
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.879
dynamic programming shows a easy method

98
00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.079
for doing the same thing we will not we

99
00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.199
will be indirectly trying all 2 power n

100
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.840
right but not directly so we'll not

101
00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.000
spend that much time let us solve this

102
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.599
problem using tabulation method

103
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.560
tabulation method let us see how to fill

104
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.840
this values and how to get the solution

105
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.400
for this problem so for solving as the

106
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.960
capacity of the bag is8 so I have taken

107
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.520
the column so starting from 0 to

108
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.560
8 so this means that though the capacity

109
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.000
is8 but we'll not consider that eight at

110
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.759
once so we'll add weight one by one so

111
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.240
starting from zero then let us assume

112
00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.160
weight is one weight is two and so on

113
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.080
then rows four objects so I have taken

114
00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.759
five 0 1 2 3 4 so starting from zero so

115
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.758
it means 1 by we will consider the

116
00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.560
object so initially we will not consider

117
00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.840
any object means we will not include any

118
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.479
object in the bag so for filling this we

119
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.198
have a formula so I'll show you formula

120
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.000
after some time after filling some

121
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.000
values so let us see first row as zero

122
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.880
object no object is included then what

123
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.840
will be the profit so in these boxes

124
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.800
I'll be writing the profit so there is

125
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.080
no profit gained when no object is

126
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.160
included and even when the capacity of

127
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.560
the bag is zero this are the this is the

128
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.759
capacity these are the weights right and

129
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.280
these are weights and the profits of the

130
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.400
objects so these are the weights and

131
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.520
there is zero weight is there then all

132
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.080
these are 0 0

133
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.880
0

134
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.400
next now we will start filling so for

135
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.680
that I'll consider first object when I

136
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.960
consider first object I'll take this row

137
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.199
and I will ignore all other

138
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.758
objects and similarly when I go to

139
00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.520
second row I'll ignore the remaining and

140
00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.319
I will take the second object as well as

141
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.719
the first object I'll consider the first

142
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:08.400
object also so it means whenever I am in

143
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.599
I throw I will consider all the objects

144
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.758
in the previous rows also so for the

145
00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.880
first row directly I can fill it let us

146
00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:19.960
see first row what is the weight of the

147
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.599
first object two so it can be filled

148
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.318
only when the bag capacity is two so

149
00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:28.599
here so what will be the profit one so

150
00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:31.120
fill one here then this means this is

151
00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:35.080
same value previous value usually we

152
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.400
write previous value only if required

153
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.120
then rest of the cells the capacity of

154
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.440
the bag is increasing but how many

155
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.440
objects I'm considering only one so I

156
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.919
don't have anything more to fill in the

157
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:51.039
bag so only that object I can fill and

158
00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.039
it will be getting profit as one one one

159
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.400
only I'll fill the second row also right

160
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.639
third row also in the same way then I

161
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.520
will write down the formula let us go to

162
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.280
second row I'm going to consider second

163
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.560
object so as I said when I consider

164
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.400
second object I should also include the

165
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.280
first object so first let us look at the

166
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.440
second object see the weight of the

167
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.119
second object is three it can be filled

168
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.719
in the bag only if the capacity is three

169
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.319
so in this cell only it can be filled so

170
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.960
what is the profit that I'll get two so

171
00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.479
put two here what about this side it

172
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.520
will be same value same value as the

173
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:32.318
previous rle then beyond this what

174
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.240
should come here so as I said that when

175
00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:37.520
you are taking second object you should

176
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.639
also consider first object so if I fill

177
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.039
the second object also in the back total

178
00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:46.000
weight required is how much five so this

179
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.240
is five and total profit will be three

180
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.440
so both the objects can be filled when

181
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.159
the capacity is five and the total

182
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.039
profit will be three so here both of

183
00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:57.280
them can be

184
00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:59.560
filled right both of them I'm

185
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.440
considering both of them so now I have

186
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.680
have only two objects and this is giving

187
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.080
for both the objects are filled so rest

188
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.960
of the values will be 3 3 3 then what

189
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.240
will be the value here so as this is two

190
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.758
so this will also be two so I can take

191
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.159
the previous value or this value

192
00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:18.240
whichever is maximum I can take the same

193
00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:20.199
thing now I will fill the third object

194
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.840
also then for the fourth object I will

195
00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:25.800
show you the formula third object when I

196
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.799
consider third object if you look at

197
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.159
these the maximum weight is this one and

198
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.479
as they are arranged in the increasing

199
00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:34.279
order of the weight so this is weight is

200
00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:36.880
four so this object can be filled in the

201
00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:40.039
bag only if the capacity of the bag is

202
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.919
four so this will be included in the bag

203
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.480
when the capacity is four so the total

204
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.959
profit that you'll be getting is five so

205
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:51.640
this is five then before that whatever

206
00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:55.640
the previous row values are so 2 1 and

207
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.079
zero now Beyond this let us see see when

208
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.240
I on the third object I should also

209
00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:01.199
consider first first and the second

210
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.959
object

211
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.000
also so if I just check them this is

212
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:10.640
four and if I take these two objects it

213
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.640
will be total six weight weight is six

214
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.240
so these two objects I can fill if the

215
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.720
weight is six right a if I want to fill

216
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.560
these two then these two I can fill when

217
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.160
the weight is

218
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.640
seven this two I can fill if the weight

219
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.560
is five and what will do the profit

220
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.920
three this object itself is five right

221
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.560
now I will consider these two six and

222
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.640
the total weight will be six so at six

223
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.119
it will be six only right and when I

224
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.720
consider these two so total is seven

225
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.360
seven and the profit is also seven so at

226
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.320
seven the profit is seven can I include

227
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.959
all three it will be 10 but the capacity

228
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.680
of the bag is only eight so I cannot

229
00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:58.959
include all three then beyond this the

230
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:03.800
value will be seven only and before this

231
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:03.800
one the value will be same as this five

232
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.839
five all right now I will show you the

233
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.279
formula and I will fill fourth row with

234
00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:17.519
that formula the formula is like this if

235
00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:21.880
I call this table as V this table as V

236
00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:26.040
then V of I comma w i is the row number

237
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.160
W is the column number is maximum

238
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:32.839
of V of i- 1 that is from the previous

239
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.719
row I should take same value means

240
00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:38.440
previous row value I should take this is

241
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:43.720
the meaning or maximum of this one or

242
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:46.839
what V of IUS 1 comma weight minus

243
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:52.639
weight of an object

244
00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:54.800
wi plus profit of an object that you are

245
00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:57.040
considering now let us the follow the

246
00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.800
formula and fill all

247
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:07.920
these first one 4A 1 I will fill 4A 1 so

248
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:12.880
V of 4A 1 is maximum

249
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:17.920
of V of 3A 1 like this is four so this

250
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:21.000
will be three comma V of 3 comma weight

251
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:25.959
is how much 1 minus weight of an object

252
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:31.240
weight of an object is 5 1 - 5 plus

253
00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:31.239
profit of that object is six six

254
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.959
now this becomes 3A

255
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.000
-4 there is no such location so that

256
00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:43.359
value becomes undefined so only this

257
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.760
value will be defined V of 3 comma 1

258
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.079
will be defined so V of 3 comma 1 is

259
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.959
what zero so I should take zero

260
00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:54.279
only there will not be any such index V

261
00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:57.439
of 3 comma -4 yes for that I have to

262
00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:59.600
take zero only so it means up to what

263
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.480
I'll be getting negative numbers up to

264
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.320
fifth weight up to fifth weight so till

265
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:09.279
here I should fill these values as it is

266
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.639
only so that's what I was saying that

267
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:13.880
this can be considered or this can be

268
00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:16.600
considered in fourth so write on its

269
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.560
value and all previous values as it is

270
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.040
so the same thing here because there you

271
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.518
will be getting negative so till fifth

272
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.880
weight till fifth weight before that

273
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:28.040
till before that I have filled as it is

274
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:35.399
now this fifth way how to fill I will

275
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:37.279
show you for this value 4A 5 V of 4A 5

276
00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:45.360
is maximum

277
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:49.240
of V of 3 comma 5 comma V of 3 comma

278
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.160
weight is how much five minus weight of

279
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.480
this object is how much

280
00:12:51.160 --> 00:13:00.360
five plus profit of this object is how

281
00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:06.600
much 6 6 let us see V of 3 comma 5 3A 5

282
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:12.399
is how much 5 comma V of 3A 5 - 1 5 - 5

283
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:15.120
0 V of 3 comma 0 3 comma 0 is 0 plus 6

284
00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:18.000
so which is greater 6 is greater so fill

285
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.040
this value with six so that means this

286
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.560
object is included

287
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:33.199
here now 4A 6 I will find out V of 4A 6

288
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:36.319
is maximum of V of 3A 6 comma V of 3

289
00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:38.920
comma weight is 6 right and the weight

290
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:42.560
of the object is 5

291
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:46.399
plus profit of the object is 6 so how

292
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:53.839
much this is V of 3A 6 is how much 3A 6

293
00:13:46.399 --> 00:14:00.399
is 6 6 comma V of 3 comma 6 - 1 6 - 5

294
00:13:53.839 --> 00:14:03.320
that is 1 3A 1 3A 1 is how much 0 0 + 6

295
00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:05.399
so the answer is both are same only so

296
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:12.959
take six

297
00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:20.120
only next value 4A 7 V of 4A 7 maximum

298
00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:23.000
of V of 3A 7 comma V of 3 comma weight

299
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:28.720
is how much 7 so weight of the object is

300
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.639
5 7 - 5 plus profit is 6 so this is 3A 7

301
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:39.600
is how much 7 comma this is V of 3A 7 -

302
00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:43.279
5 is 2 3A 2 so 3A 2 is how much 1 + 6 so

303
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.040
this is 1 + 6 so this is 7 only both I

304
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:47.320
am getting s or 7 so they are same only

305
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:54.719
take

306
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:59.120
seven V of 4A 8 4A 8 is maximum

307
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.120
of V of

308
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.720
3A 8 comma V of 3 comma weight is 8

309
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.959
minus the weight of an object is 5 +

310
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:17.079
profit is

311
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:21.359
6 3A 8 how much 3A 8 is 7 comma V of 3A

312
00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:24.880
8 - 5 is 3 3 comma 3 how much 2 so this

313
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.480
is 2 + 6 so how much this is this is

314
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.480
seven and this is 8 so answer

315
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.480
is8 so this is how the table is filled

316
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.399
so I have used the formula for few cells

317
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:39.160
in the last row and this can also be

318
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:40.800
filled directly also without the formula

319
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.880
let me show you how to fill this last

320
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.719
row

321
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.199
directly I am considering fourth object

322
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.240
whose weight is five and the profit is

323
00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:54.479
six so in fifth column just write six

324
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.800
it's profit and what to write on the

325
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.560
cells before that same value as the

326
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:04.359
previous row

327
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:06.719
this what you do first then beyond this

328
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.279
now the weight is five Beyond this the

329
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.680
capacity of the bag is increasing so I

330
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:14.199
can include other objects also so let us

331
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.519
check other objects what I can include

332
00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:18.959
in the sixth column this object is

333
00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:23.560
definitely because its profit is maximum

334
00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:26.880
right 5 + 2 7 at 6 nothing will happen

335
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.959
so take six only at seven I can consider

336
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:34.560
these two these two so this is six + 1 7

337
00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:37.040
7 then at 8 when the bag capacity eight

338
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.560
which of the objects I can consider 5 +

339
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:44.079
3 8 so 6 and 2 8 so this is

340
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.079
8 so whichever objects that you can

341
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:48.758
consider you just add them and in that

342
00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:51.519
capacity if they are fitting in you

343
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:53.880
write on the Max total profit so this is

344
00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:55.319
a simple method for filling the cells

345
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.720
instead of following this complex

346
00:16:55.319 --> 00:17:00.560
formula you can follow that method so I

347
00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:05.640
have shown you both

348
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.280
solution I have to write down X1 X2 X3

349
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.039
X4

350
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.199
values now

351
00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:15.199
these now for finding these answers

352
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:17.520
actually I'll be taking sequence of

353
00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:19.240
decision now see the decisions can be

354
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.480
taken only if you have the data yes we

355
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.120
have kept the data ready the formula was

356
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.880
used for filling this data now I have to

357
00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.639
take the sequence of decision so how to

358
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.160
solve so actually I have to know which

359
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.480
object should be included and which

360
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.360
should not be included in the bag so let

361
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.720
us come with the maximum profit that is

362
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.600
eight the last cell this eight is

363
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.640
generated only in fourth row and in that

364
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.360
previous row you don't find eight

365
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.160
anywhere so it means we got this say

366
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.240
because of including fourth object only

367
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.880
so include the fourth

368
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.679
object right profit is eight fourth

369
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.880
object is included because eight is not

370
00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:02.360
there in previous row now what is the

371
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.640
profit of the a a fourth object 8 minus

372
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.840
profit is six six so this is

373
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.240
two now remaining profit is two now

374
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.158
check whether two is there in the third

375
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.400
row now I have to check for the third

376
00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:17.880
object fourth then third then second and

377
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.600
then one so third object two is there

378
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.960
yes the same value two is there in the

379
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.240
previous row also yes it is there so it

380
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.760
means it is not because of third object

381
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.760
so don't include third

382
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.760
object now let us consider second object

383
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.120
is it two there here in the second row

384
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.679
yes two is there here is it there in the

385
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.080
first row also no so it means this we

386
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:43.039
got because of inclusion of the second

387
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.158
object so take this as one so now

388
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:49.600
remaining is 2 - 2 so

389
00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:51.200
zero now zero was it there in the first

390
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.879
object so I have to consider the first

391
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.640
object yes zero was there in the first

392
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.840
object row was it there in the zero also

393
00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.240
yes it was there in the zero also this

394
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.080
row also so it means don't include the

395
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.679
object so this is the solution so it

396
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:08.158
means which objects are included in the

397
00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:11.240
bag X2 and X4 two objects are included

398
00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:12.919
in the back so that is X2 is this one X4

399
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.280
is this one so total profit will be

400
00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:18.000
eight so this is the maximum profit of

401
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.039
01 napsack

402
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.120
problem next I will solve it using sets

403
00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:25.039
method same problem I will solve it

404
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.840
using set method now let us solve it

405
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:29.679
using set method set method will try to

406
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.559
find all possible possibilities and pick

407
00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:35.200
up the best solution so let us see how

408
00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:38.080
sets are generated we will prepare a set

409
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.120
of order pay that is profit and weight

410
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.840
so we'll start with set

411
00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:47.120
zero set zero in this we say no profit

412
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.080
no weight means nothing is included in

413
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.600
the

414
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.039
bag then we will consider the first

415
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.120
object that is 1 comma 2 whose profit is

416
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:58.760
one and the weight is two so consider

417
00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.678
the first object so prepare s0 of 1 and

418
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.679
and include this first object in the bag

419
00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:06.600
so it will be 1 comma

420
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:08.880
2 so actually add one comma to this

421
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.439
order pair so we get this one now

422
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.120
prepare set

423
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.280
one then merge these two order Pairs and

424
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.158
prepare this

425
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.520
one so this means

426
00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:24.000
that we have considered first object so

427
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.879
two order pairs are showing that first

428
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.200
object is not included first object is

429
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.080
included

430
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.080
now let us

431
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.240
prepare next set by considering second

432
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:41.639
object so that is 2 + 3 so prepare next

433
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:45.640
set that is S11 so add 2 three to these

434
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:48.120
order pairs 2 + 3 so this is 2 comma 3

435
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.360
then 2 + 3 is added so this will become

436
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:55.760
3 + 3A

437
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:58.000
5 then this is second set for the second

438
00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.200
object so when you consider second

439
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.679
object to total four order pairs all

440
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:07.159
these are merged so this is 1 2 and 2 3

441
00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:11.000
and this is

442
00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:13.080
35 this means that no object is included

443
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.880
first object is included second object

444
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.120
is included both objects are included

445
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:24.240
four possibilities are there so all the

446
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:27.959
order pairs we got then prepare S2 of 1

447
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.880
by considering third object 5A 4 add 5A

448
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.200
4 to all all so this 5 + 4 so this is 5

449
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:38.679
+ 4

450
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:43.279
is 5A 4 only so 5 + 4 so this will

451
00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:47.320
become 6 and 6 so this is 6a 6 5 + 4 so

452
00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:49.440
this is 7A 7 so five is added to this

453
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.080
and four is added to this so This become

454
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.039
8 comma 9 8 comma

455
00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:03.559
9 now merge all these and take order

456
00:21:56.039 --> 00:22:04.840
pair so set three we get it as 0 0 1 2

457
00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:07.720
then 2

458
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:10.678
3 then

459
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.200
35 then

460
00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:15.360
54 then 6

461
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:21.080
6

462
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:23.840
77 now here 8 comma 99 profit is 8 and

463
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.559
the weight is 9 so that is exceeding the

464
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.959
capacity of the bag don't include that

465
00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:33.840
one

466
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:37.480
so we have discarded that right now this

467
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:40.080
is set three in this one if You

468
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.159
observe this is profit this is weight

469
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.320
profit increase weight increase then

470
00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:47.000
from this profit increase weight also

471
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.520
increase profit increased and the weight

472
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.840
also increased but here profit increase

473
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.600
weight is decreased from 5 to 4 this is

474
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.678
not possible profit is increasing so the

475
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.520
weight is also increasing but weight is

476
00:22:58.679 --> 00:23:03.640
decreased how this possible so that's

477
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.840
why this order pair are wrong so we have

478
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.919
to discard any one so we will discard

479
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:13.320
the one with the Lesser profit smaller

480
00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:16.159
profit so 1 2 3 4 5 6 now we have only

481
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.799
six order pirs because two were invalid

482
00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:20.760
one was this was giving wrong values and

483
00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:23.320
this was exceeding the capacity of the

484
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.760
back so cutting of this one we call it

485
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.520
as dominance rule so with the dominance

486
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.559
rule the value is order pair is

487
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:34.320
discarded now I will consider fourth

488
00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:38.240
object 6A 5 I will include so I will

489
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:41.158
prepare set 3 one by considering fourth

490
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.279
objects 6A 5 so first order pair is 6

491
00:23:41.159 --> 00:23:48.360
comma 5 next order pair is 6 and five

492
00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:52.640
are added so this is 7A 7 then 6 and

493
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:55.959
five are added so this is 8 comma 8 and

494
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.440
then 6 and 5 when they are added it will

495
00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:02.120
become 11 comma

496
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:05.720
9 6 and 5 added so this become 12 comma

497
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:09.360
11 and 6 5 when added to 7 and 7 so this

498
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:12.520
becomes 13A

499
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.360
12 now I have to prepare set four this

500
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:19.200
is the final set must these order pairs

501
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:26.639
so 0 0 is taken from here 1A 2 and 2

502
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:30.399
comma 3 and 5A 4 6A 6 and 7A 7 they are

503
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:35.799
coming as it is now in one 6A 5 is there

504
00:24:30.399 --> 00:24:37.840
so 6A 5 should come before 7A 7 so 6A 5

505
00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:39.240
now here again you see the profit is

506
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.080
remaining same but the weight is

507
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:46.919
reducing so this should be removed then

508
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.879
7 comma 7 is there then 8A 8 is there

509
00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:53.320
then remaining 11a 9 exceeding the

510
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.919
capacity of the Back 9 11 and 12 so all

511
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.520
three order pairs are gone so these are

512
00:24:55.919 --> 00:25:02.320
the order pairs I have so if You observe

513
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:04.879
the method is generating all

514
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.480
possibilities so this is one easy method

515
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.520
of finding all possibilities so the time

516
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.399
taken by this one is almost 2 power

517
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.639
n now what is the solution so we have

518
00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:17.959
already sets now we take the sequence of

519
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:23.799
decisions to solve this one now what is

520
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:26.679
the maximum order of air 8A 8 so 8 comma

521
00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:28.679
8 Now using that I will solve this one

522
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:32.679
so the approach is similar like what we

523
00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:34.600
saw in the tabular method 8A 8 belongs

524
00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:40.279
to set

525
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:43.520
4 but 8A 8 check whether it belonged to

526
00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:46.279
set three in the set 3 8A 8 was not

527
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.080
there so it doesn't belong to set three

528
00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:52.240
therefore fourth object is included

529
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:56.039
because of that only we got 4A

530
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.159
4 now I should take an order pair 8

531
00:25:56.039 --> 00:26:01.440
comma 8 from this I should subtract the

532
00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:03.640
profit and weight of the fourth object

533
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.240
so this is profit is six and the weight

534
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:10.600
is five so the order pair is how much 2

535
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:13.080
comma 3 so now I should consider 2 comma

536
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:17.158
3 so now this was the first one now

537
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:20.000
second one 2A 3 now I have to consider

538
00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:27.320
third object so check whether it belongs

539
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.919
to S3 2A 3 yes it belongs to S3 and 2A 3

540
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:33.960
belongs to s 2 check whether it belongs

541
00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:36.320
to S2 s2a 3 is there here also it means

542
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.720
this is not because of the third object

543
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:43.399
so therefore third object is not

544
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:47.159
included in the back then now next step

545
00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:49.879
is I will consider second object 2A 3

546
00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:52.720
belongs to set two for second object 2

547
00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:58.720
comma 3 now does it belong to set

548
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:58.720
1 but 2 comma 3

549
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.320
doesn't belong to set 1 so 2 comma 3 was

550
00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:07.760
belonging to set 2 and 2 comma 3 doesn't

551
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.799
belong to set 1 so therefore this is

552
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.158
because of the second object that is

553
00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:14.520
included now what is the profit and

554
00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:17.520
weight of the second object 2A 3 so when

555
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:24.000
you subtract 2 comma 3 from this one 2 -

556
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:26.480
2 is 0 and 3 - 3 is 0 so this gives 0a 0

557
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.240
now first object I will consider now the

558
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:37.320
step is four so 0 0 belongs to set 1 and

559
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:40.399
also 0a 0 belongs to set 0 therefore

560
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:44.320
first object is also not

561
00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:46.479
included 0a 0 belongs to S1 also s0 also

562
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.639
it means this is obtained not because of

563
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.799
the first object so first object is also

564
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:55.240
not included then the solution is from

565
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:58.760
bottom if you see 0 1 0 1 so the answer

566
00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.760
is 0 1 0 1

567
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.320
so these two objects are included see

568
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.960
the profit is eight so we got the same

569
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.279
solution with the help of sets also so

570
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:11.760
this is one more

571
00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:13.760
method that's all about 01 nsect problem

572
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.600
leave a comment and let me know whether

573
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.039
it was easy for you to understand so I

574
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.799
have shown you both the steps for

575
00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:21.679
solving 01 naap problem right in some

576
00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:25.600
places we find tabulation method and

577
00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:25.600
some places we find the sets method
